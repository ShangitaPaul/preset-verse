# Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how you can implement an AI surfboard generator and recommendation engine using Python
"""Please note that this code is a simplified example and may require additional modifications and integration with specific APIs and machine learning models. You'll need to replace 'your_api_key' with your actual API key for the wave conditions API, and 'surfboard_model.pkl' with the filename of your trained surfboard recommendation model.

Make sure to train the machine learning model using appropriate data before using it in the generate_surfboard_recommendation function. Additionally, may need to install the necessary libraries such as requests, numpy, and scikit-learn using pip or any other package manager.

Remember to adapt and expand this code according to your specific requirements and the APIs and models you intend to use."""
